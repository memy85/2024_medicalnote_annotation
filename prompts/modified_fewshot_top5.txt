### Context : Followup rheumatoid arthritis. 
1. Rheumatoid arthritis, seropositive. 
2. Hyperlipidemia. 
3. Hypothyroidism. 
4. Hodgkin's lymphoma status post chemotherapy, radiation many years ago. 
5. Status post bilateral bunionectomies xxx. 
6. Positive hepatitis C antibody with negative viral loads and normal LFTs. 
7. Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, worse on the right, status post surgical release in xxx. 
8. Osteoporosis with abnormal bone density study in xxx with a T-score of -3.5 in the lumbar spine and -2.7 in the femoral neck. 
SURGICAL, SOCIAL, AND FAMILY HISTORY: Unchanged from initial consult note dated xxx. 
Methotrexate 17.5 mg. po q. week, folic acid 800 mcg daily, Plaquenil 200 mg daily. Acidophilus daily, Astaxanthin 4 mg/day, calcium/D 600-200 one tab bid, fish oil 1000 mg/d, Krill oil 100 mg daily, Levoxyl 75 mcg daily, Turmeric, niacin 500 mg/d, vitamin D3 2000 units daily, selenium daily (mg unknown). 
Mrs. name is a 69-year-old female presenting to rheumatology clinic for followup of rheumatoid arthritis. I last saw her xxx. 
She is doing good except for ongoing L wrist swelling which is typically not tender. She denies difficulty with ADLs. Last week her hands were sore after doing yardwork. She does not take analgesics or steroids. 
On xxx DAS28 was 2.62 - low RA activity. She's done very good on the current therapy. She also takes multiple natural supplements which she feel help her energy levels. She exercises and is able to carry on with ADLs without difficulty. She's adapted some kitchen tools, knives, etc, as she has waxing and waning painful triggering of the R index finger. The left wrist is swollen from time to time and feels weak. She denies hand pain otherwise. 
On xxx DXA was remarkable for LS spine T score of 3. and hip -2.3. These values are mildly improved from 5/2007. She declines bisphosphonates, and continues taking calcium and vitamin D. 
She is on methotrexate + Plaquenil duotherapy doing well. She had active disease at one point but didn't feel comfortable with the side effect profile of parenteral biologics. She's done OK on the current dose of methotrexate, with no side effects. She has chronic left wrist swelling but no longer has pain. She denies difficulty with ADLs, therefore name score is 0.00 today. Denies paresthesias. She recovered well s/p right carpal tunnel release in date. She also takes Plaquenil, however just 200 mg/d as she reported difficulty swallowing the tablets in xxx, so she no longer takes two tabs. She was on NSAIDs in the past but has not taken any in a while, as she would rather minimize her use of meds to prevent side effects. She has a positive hepatitis C antibody but negative viral loads and repeatedly normal LFTs with no signs of methotrexate toxicity. She needs follow up labs today. She has hyperlipidemia, now on niacin, and requests a lipid panel checked. In the past she was on statins which caused myalgias. 
She's had on / off triggering of the right index finger. This can be painful. It's not currently active. 
DAS28 has been consistently low. 
She continues working. She is very active and denies physical limiations. She walks 30 minutes daily. 
As above. All other systems are negative in detail. 
Vital signs: Weight 125 lbs, BP 92/50, HR 76, Temp 98.4. General: She is a pleasant, well-nourished female in no acute distress. She arrives alone. HEENT: Pupils equal, round, reactive to light, EOMI, anicteric. Neck is supple, no lymphadenopathy. Lungs and chest are clear. Abdomen is soft, nontender. Skin is free of rash. Extremities: No edema. Neuro: Motor strength 5/5 upper and lower extremities. Musculoskeletal: Her gait is intact. She is able to get on and off the examination table without assistance. She is right-handed and grip strength is adequate bilaterally. There is good range of motion of the neck, shoulders, and elbows. Wrists have decreased dorsiflexion. There is left wrist synovitis without tenderness. MCPs, PIPs, and DIPs are nontender. Hips, knees, and ankles move well. MTPs nontender. Right 2nd A1 pulley not tender or nodular. 
I reviewed with her labs done last visit: CBC with diff, AST, ALT, BUN, creatinine, ESR, CRP. 
Recent DXA per HPI above. 
Mrs. name is a 69-year-old female presenting to rheumatology clinic for followup. 
1. Seropositive rheumatoid arthritis. She has chronic left wrist arthritis, which I have injected in the past. Overall though, this isn't too bothersome for her and she denies difficulty with ADLs. Denies pain. I will repeat labs today. She's doing good but given ongoing L wrist swelling I don't recommend decreasing methotrexate. She will continue Plaquenil 200 mg/d. 
We've discussed the role of biologics but she doesn't want to take "another chronic med". She understands ongoing synovitis of the L wrist is a sign of disease activity and may pose risk of progression, joint damage, and disability. 
I sent all med renewals to mail away pharmacy electronically previously. 
She prefers to take OTC folic acid 800 mcg/day, instead of prescription folic acid 1 mg/d, which is cheaper for her. 
2. Osteoporosis. This remains untreated per her choice. She understands this poses risk of fracture. Recent DXA was reviewed. 
3. Carpal tunnel syndrome. Resolved status post surgical release on the right in xxx. 
4. Vitamin D deficiency. She will continue OTC daily supplement for maintenance. 
5. General health. Checked lipid panel last visit, xxx: Total cholesterol 254 mg/dL, LDL 150 mg/dL. 

1. Continue methotrexate at current dose. 
2. Check CBC with diff, AST, ALT, BUN, creatinine, ESR, CRP today and every 2 months. Standing order was entered in Allscripts. 
3. Continue Plaquenil 200 mg po daily. 
4. She declines bisphosphonates. 
The patient is agreeable with this plan. I have answered all of her questions. She will follow up with me in 6 months or sooner if needed.

name name is a 58-year-old man referred for evaluation of thrombocytosis. No recent laboratory studies are available to me and labs from xxxx are pending at this time. He has had long-standing mild thrombocytosis and the potential differential diagnosis is large; notable contributors may be his Crohn disease of several years' duration, possible gastrointestinal bleeding with iron deficiency anemia. There is no clinical evidence of chronic infections in the form of tuberculosis or fungal infections and he has no clear autoimmune illness. He does not manifest symptoms of name from iron deficiency, but I did ask him to continue to take oral iron until we have iron studies available. The differential diagnosis also includes myeloproliferative neoplasms, and I await the results of the CBC before ordering more specialized tests, such as BCR-ABL for CML. I have asked him to return to see me in 1-2 weeks after laboratory studies are available. He promised to obtain results from name name and other specialists whom he has seen.
