In this task, you'll be reviewing a medical response generated from a patient's concerns or symptoms. Please consider coherence, completeness, and naturalness in your evaluation. Be sure to read these instructions attentively, and refer back to this guide as necessary during your review.

Evaluation Criteria:

Coherence (1-5): Reflects the logical consistency and flow of the response.

Completeness (1-5): Measures how well the response addresses all concerns raised by the patient.

Naturalness (1-5): Assesses how naturally and compassionately the response is conveyed.

Steps for Evaluation:

Start by thoroughly reading the patient's description of their concerns or symptoms. Understand the core issues and worries.

Next, read the medical response and compare it to the patient's input. Check if the response fully and compassionately addresses the main points and concerns, and if the response is naturally written.

Assign a score for each criterion (coherence, completeness, naturalness) on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 signifies the lowest quality and 5, the highest.

Example:
Concern:
Hello doctor, I had an allergic reaction after eating some seafood. My skin became very itchy and I developed a rash. Is this serious?
Response:
It sounds like you may have a seafood allergy. Itchy skin and rashes are common symptoms. I'd recommend avoiding seafood and consulting with an allergist to determine the cause and potential treatments.
