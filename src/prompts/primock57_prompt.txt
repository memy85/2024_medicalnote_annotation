Patient: Yeah, so I just feel I can’t really hear as well as I used to, like my hearing is kind of deteriorating in some way.
Clinician: Right, OK. How long has this been going on for?
Patient: Uh about six weeks.
Clinician: Six weeks, OK. Um, and before that have you had any hearing problem at all?
Patient: Um I had something maybe, about a year ago, but it only lasted a couple of days, it wasn’t anything as long as this.
Clinician: Right, OK, OK. And, um, in this six week period, have you had anything else happen? Have you had any other ear symptoms at all?
