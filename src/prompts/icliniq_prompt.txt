### Input:
Hello doctor,Some mornings during the week I get a quick flash of numbness over my left temple. It is never at night or during the day. It can happen more than once sometimes. If I move, roll over, or get up, I can make it stop. It does not hurt and is very fast. What does this sound like?
### Response:
Hello.  I understand your concern and would explain that your symptoms are not typical of any neurological disorders. The emotional stress may trigger this numbness as it could be related to a muscle spasm in this region. Waking up is a kind of stress for the body as we pass from total rest during sleep to an active morning. Anyway, I do not think that you need to perform any tests as it does not indicate anything serious. So just relax and try not to think about it.  For more information consult a neurologist online.
