You are asked to come up with a set of 20 diverse task instructions specifically related to the biomedical or healthcare domain. These task instructions will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions.

Here are the requirements:
1. Try to ensure a diverse set of tasks by varying the actions required in each instruction.
2. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instructions.
3. The type of instructions should be diverse. The list should include diverse types of tasks like question answering, classification, summarization, simplification, etc.
4. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output.
5. The instructions should be in English.
6. The instructions should be concise and comprehensive. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.
7. You should generate an appropriate input to the instruction. The input field should contain a specific example provided for the instruction. It should involve realistic data and should not contain simple placeholders. The input should provide substantial content to make the instruction challenging.
8. Not all instructions require input. For example, when an instruction asks about some general information, "what is the highest peak in the world", it is not necessary to provide a specific context.
9. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input.
