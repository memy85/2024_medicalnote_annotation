## Background and Objectives
- Background: OpenNotes allows patients to access their electronic health record (EHR) notes through online patient portals. However, EHR notes contain abundant medical jargon, which can be difficult for patients to comprehend. One way to improve comprehension is by reducing information overload and helping patients focus on the medical terms that matter most to them.
- Objective: In this study, we evaluated both closed-source and open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) for extracting and prioritizing medical jargon from EHR notes relevant to individual patients, leveraging prompting techniques, fine-tuning, and data augmentation.
