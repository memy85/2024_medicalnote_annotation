### Extracting CUI's from UMLS2023
- `activate transformer_limitation` : python version 3.9
- `run quickuml.server` 
- `run extract_medical_jargon_from_mimic.py from src. Activate with env transformer_limitation`

### Comparing the results 
- `make cv_no_results` : This outputs the performance of the vanilla models
