Prior CBCs from xxxx through xxxx revealed platelet counts ranging from 400,000 to 500,000, but no more recent studies are available. He has long-standing Crohn disease and although he says he has not had gastrointestinal bleeding in the past, he has been given iron, which he is taking twice daily. He has black stool, but notes no blood and he has not had hematemesis. He notes no blood in his urine or sputum and he has no epistaxis. He discontinued the use of iron yesterday because he thought that might alleviate his gastrointestinal complaints, but he does not feel different today. He is cared for by Dr. name name at St. hospital Medical Center in location. He has no history of prior cancers, tuberculosis or other infectious diseases. He has been taking budesonide for his Crohn disease. He has no unexplained fevers, although he states he often feels hot. He has no soaking sweats and has not had unexplained weight loss. He believes he was referred to an oncologist many years ago at Streetin location, xxxx, but he cannot recall the reason for that referral, who the doctor was, or what the findings were. He often feels queasy and nauseated, but has no vomiting. He has loose stools up to 4 days per week, but has had a stable pattern of Crohn disease. Also notable for diabetes mellitus for which he takes metformin and has required no insulin and has had no complications of retinopathy or renal dysfunction, Crohn disease as described above and an enlarged prostate. \n",
      "Aspirin, budesonide 3 mg extended release tablet b.i.d., docusate sodium, fenofibrate, ibuprofen, metformin 500 mg 4 times a day, omeprazole and vitamin D. \n",

      "He is a former construction worker and carpenter on disability since xxxx. He is active doing yard work. He has no formal exercise regimen. He eats a well-balanced diet and recently experimented with a gluten-free diet. He smokes occasional cannabis. Drinks no alcohol, although he drank at least a 12-pack of beer daily and often more until 3 years ago. He had no history of withdrawal symptoms, seizures or delirium tremens and did not know of cirrhosis or liver disease. He does not smoke cigarettes. \n",
      "Father died at age 80 with an unknown cancer that may have been prostate cancer. His mother died at age 68 with an unknown blood disorder. He has an older brother with diabetes, 2 older sisters and a younger sister, all of whom are well. He has a son who is 28 and a daughter who is 24, both of whom are competitive athletes and healthy. No clear family history of hematologic malignancies, although his mother died with an unknown blood disorder. \n",
      "Notable for the absence of abdominal fullness, early satiety, nausea or vomiting. He has black stools, but no bloody stools. Weight has been stable. No fevers or soaking sweats. All other systems are negative except as detailed in the HPI. \n",

He has had long-standing mild thrombocytosis and the potential differential diagnosis is large; notable contributors may be his Crohn disease of several years' duration, possible gastrointestinal bleeding with iron deficiency anemia. There is no clinical evidence of chronic infections in the form of tuberculosis or fungal infections and he has no clear autoimmune illness. He does not manifest symptoms of name from iron deficiency, but I did ask him to continue to take oral iron until we have iron studies available. The differential diagnosis also includes myeloproliferative neoplasms, and I await the results of the CBC before ordering more specialized tests, such as BCR-ABL for CML. I have asked him to return to see me in 1-2 weeks after laboratory studies are available. He promised to obtain results from name name and other specialists whom he has seen. \n",

      "This is a 50-year-old male with a history of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, who is coming in complaining of a one-month history of abdominal cramping in the epigastric region. The patient reports that his IBS was diagnosed two to three years ago when he presented with a history of alternating constipation and diarrhea post stressful events. He reports that his usual IBS flares last for 24-48 hours after a clear stressor and then spontaneously resolve. He reports that he had a sigmoidoscopy at that time, which was unremarkable, to rule out other pathologies such as IBD. He also has in the intervening time had a screening colonoscopy, where he underwent a polypectomy about two to three years ago, during which time he was also again found to not have any lesions consistent with inflammatory bowel disease. The patient reports that his IBS has been well controlled. About a month ago, he purchased a plane with the intent of renewing his pilot's license and has been stressed from this purchase as well as repeating his flight school. He reports that during this time, he has had a month of epigastric and right upper quadrant crampy abdominal pain, about xxx at baseline and only going up to an intensity of 2/10. These reports it as a crampy sensation associated with flatulence and belching. He reports that passage of gas actually relieves the pain. He also reports that passage of bowel movements also relieves the pain. He states that he has had no changes in his bowel patterns. He has two well-formed appropriately-colored bowel movements on a daily basis. He had been taking Colace until a week prior because he had a flareup of his hemorrhoids; however, this has resolved over the last week, and he reports no further bowel movement abnormalities. He has also no urinary abnormalities. He denies dysuria. He has no problems initiating urinary stream. He has no hesitancy and has no sensation of postvoid residual. Otherwise, he denies fevers, chills, headaches, chest pain, palpitation, shortness of breath, lower extremity swelling, mouth lesions, joint pain, any new rashes, or hair loss. He does have a 20- to 25-pound weight loss over the last year, which is intentional with dietary restriction being the primary method of weight loss.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY \n",

      "Vital signs: BMI 32.14 kg/m2, blood pressure 126/94, heart rate 92, temperature 98.4. Pain level is 1 in the epigastric region. HEENT: Mucous membranes are moist. Extraocular muscles are intact. Pupils are equally round and reactive to light bilaterally. Tympanic membranes were intact, although only partially visualized due to bilateral cerumen impaction. No oral lesions were noted. Neck: No jugular venous distention, no anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, no palpable thyroid masses. Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2 normal. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops were appreciated. Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No rales, rhonchi, or wheezing were appreciated. Abdomen: Overweight, nontender to superficial and deep palpation. No visible herniation. No palpable organomegaly. I could not reproduce any pain with any of the physical examination. He did have tympanitic abdomen with good bowel sounds in all four quadrants. Rectal examination was performed, which showed some nonbleeding external hemorrhoids. No fissures were noted. Extremities: No cyanosis. No edema. Peripheral pulses were 2+. Skin: No rashes or lesions were noted. Musculoskeletal: No obvious visible joint deformities. \n",
      "This is a 50-year-old overweight gentleman with a past medical history of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome who is coming in with a one-month history of abdominal cramping associated with a sensation of abdominal distention, relieved by passage of gas. The patient's presentation is consistent with possible irritable bowel syndrome flareup, especially given no constitutional symptoms, other than intentional weight loss, as well as no relation to dietary intake and changes in bowel patterns. However, we will be checking CBC, BMP, and LFTs to rule out infectious, metabolic, as well as other possible causes for his presentation. He has been prescribed simethicone for pain relief and was encouraged to continue taking the proton pump inhibitor for acid suppression, given his history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. He was counseled that if his labs were to come back as positive and/or if he had persistent symptoms despite the empiric simethicone trial, to come back to the clinic for further evaluation. \n",

Nonischemic cardiomyopathy: The patient, in date, had a Persantine thallium for other reasons that noted an ejection fraction of 47% and there was possibly an LAD ischemia. \\nHis xxx, heart catheterization showed a completely clean coronary system, but a low normal EF. \\nChest x-rays did not suggest sarcoidosis and iron saturation was unremarkable. \\nHis last echo was in xxx showing a normal ejection fraction. He has been maintained on beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for blood pressure, but it is unclear if he needs as much medicine as he is on. He denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea or pedal edema. No chest pain or palpitations. \\n2. History of GERD: The patient had an EGD in date that showed no evidence of name esophagus. \\nOutlet type rectal bleeding in date, colonoscopy showed just hemorrhoids. He has no abdominal pain, vomiting or nausea or bright red blood per rectum. \\n3. Fatty liver: The patient has a history of elevated liver enzymes in date. Hepatitis B and C serologies were negative. Ferritin was normal. Iron saturation was borderline, but hemochromatosis gene analysis shows he has only heterozygote for H63D. A protein electrophoresis was otherwise normal and a ceruloplasmin was normal. He does not drink much alcohol. \\n4. Hives: The patient does have a history of heat-induced hives. More recently, he had a flareup of hives because his daughter was hiding a rabbit in their house. \\n5. Sinus polyposis status post polypectomy in xxx, breathing well out of his nose. \\n6. Asthma followed by Dr. name. \\n7. Aspirin allergy: The patient is maintained on aspirin suppression. \\n8. Knee pain: The patient recalls twisting his knee on the left about 6 months ago while standing in a basketball court. Since then, he has been having medial joint line pain. He was seen in the emergency room. He was told he hadnt fractured anything. No x-rays were taken. The pain is enough that it bothers him to walk a lot. It does not lock or give. Now, the right knee is being bothered in the same location. \\n9. Left bicipital tendon tear: The patient dropped a heavy weight on his left humerus several months ago and he notices that he has lost some strength and signature either a dent or bulge in that area. \\n\\n1. Doxycycline, nausea. \\n2. Lisinopril, cough. \\n\\n1. Aspirin 325 b.i.d. \\n2. Carvedilol 25 b.i.d. \\n3. Cetirizine 10 a day. \\n4. EpiPen if needed. \\n5. Flonase nasal spray. \\n6. Ipratropium nasal spray. \\n7. Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 100/25 one a day. \\n8. Montelukast 10 a day. \\n9. Omeprazole 40 twice a day. \\n10. QVAR 2 puffs twice a day. \\n11. Serevent 50 mcg every 12 hours. \\n12. Ventolin p.r.n. \\nThe patient is a plumber Non smoker._, married, has a couple of children. Drinks a few beers a week. \\nDad passed away of pneumonia in his 70s. Dad had asthma. \\nMother in her mid to late 80s with high blood pressure. \\nHe has 8 siblings, two of whom have scleroderma, one diet of it. \\nA 12-point review of systems is otherwise negative. \\n\\nWeight of 264 and body mass index of 32. Blood pressure is 130/70 and pulse of 80. \\nOphthalmoscopic within normal limits. Oropharynx is negative. \\nNo JVD. Carotid upstrokes full, thyroid normal, no bruits. \\nClear to percussion and auscultation. \\nNormal S1 and S2, without rubs, gallops or murmurs. \\nSoft and nontender, no organomegaly. \\nWithout clubbing, cyanosis or edema. 2+ pedal pulses. Left forearm, I think he tore his bicep tendon off the ulnar and radial area. This retraction of muscle and a bulge is proximal to the antecubital fossa. Strength is okay. Reflexes are fine. Knees have no crepitance and no fluid, full range of motion. Both knees have medial joint line tenderness. No ligament laxity. Lachman's is negative. McMurray's is negative. \\nDigital rectal guaiac-negative brown stool, prostate normal. \\n\\n1. Left forearm issues: I am getting an MRI referring to hand clinic. \\n2. Trigger fingers: The patient mentions that some of his fingers are triggering. I will refer him to hand clinic. \\n3. Knee pain: I am getting x-rays. If there is not a lot of arthritis, I probably get an MRI of the left knee to see if he tore his meniscus. If there is a lot of arthritis on signature advised some therapy and perhaps orthopedic evaluation. \\n4. Nonischemic cardiomyopathy and hypertension: We can probably wean the carvedilol a little bit to 12.5 b.i.d., maybe even can try to consolidate to a daily beta-blocker. I am going to update an echo. I will see him back in several weeks. \\n5. Hypertension: Carvedilol decreased to 12.5 b.i.d. Follow up in 4-6 weeks. \\n6. Colorectal cancer screening: Next will be in date. \\n7. History of fatty liver and carrier of the H63D mutation, liver panel, CBC and ferritin. \\n8. GERD: Continue PPI therapy, had a negative endoscopy. We will update B12. \\n9. Health maintenance: The patient had Prevnar vaccine. He is up-to-date with his tetanus. I am going to get a PSA. I will see him back in 4-6 weeks. \\n||||END_OF_RECORD \\n\",\n",
