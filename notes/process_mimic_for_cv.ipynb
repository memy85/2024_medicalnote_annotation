There is \\nno abnormal enhancement of the terminal ileum. No strictures \\nwithin the small bowel are colon are \\nidentified. \\n\\nThe colon is normal in caliber. Contrast wihtin the colon may be \\nfrom prior studies, as the distal ileum is not opacified. Fat \\nstranding of the omentum and mestentary is identified.  \\n\\nThe liver, gallbladder, spleen, kidneys, adrenals, and pancreas \\nare normal. There are no enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal \\nlymph nodes. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber. The \\nportal vein is patent. The \\nproximal celiac, superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric \\narteries are \\npatent. \\n\\nCT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The appendix is normal \\n(2:56). The \\ncolon is normal in caliber. There is a moderate amount of \\nnon-hemorrhagic \\nfluid within the pelvis. A right enhancing probable hemorrhagic \\ncorpus luteum cyst measures 2.3 cm in diameter. The anteverted \\nuterus is unremarkable. There is no pelvic or inguinal \\nlymphadenopathy. \\n\\nBONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic osseous lesion is \\nidentified. \\nThere is no evidence of sacroiliitis. \\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\n1. Dilated loops of proximal ileum, with relatively decompressed \\ndistal \\nileum. Findings are consistent with partial or early small bowel \\nobstruction. \\n2. Fat stranding of the omentum and mesentery, of uncertain \\nclinical \\nsignificance.  \\n3. Moderate amount of free fluid within the pelvis. \\n.\\nPELVIS, NON-OBSTETRIC\\nFINDINGS: There is a trace amount of fluid in ___ pouch. \\nThere is a \\nlarge amount of fluid in the pelvis, which appears predominantly \\nsimple and transudative. On dedicated transvaginal imaging, \\nwhich was performed to better evaluate the adnexal structures, \\nuterus is normal in size and \\nappearance, measuring 8.9 x 5.1 x 5.4 cm in size. The \\nendometrial stripe \\nthickness is 5 mm, also within normal limits. The right ovary \\nmeasures 4.1 x 2.8 x 2.5 cm in size. The left ovary measures 3.3 \\nx 2.2 x 2.2 cm in size. No abnormal adnexal lesion is seen. \\n  \\nIMPRESSION: Large amount of free pelvic fluid, which appears \\npredominantly \\nsimple/transudative. Normal appearance of the ovaries, with no \\nleft ovarian lesion seen to correspond to the reported prior \\noutside ultrasound findings. The findings may represent a \\nruptured ovarian cyst, however, given the patient's history of \\nthree months of symptoms, other etiologies should be considered, \\nincluding endometriosis. Findings discussed with Dr. ___. \\n\\n \\nBrief Hospital Course:\\n#. Partial Small Bowel Obstruction - On arrival to ___ the \\npatient complained of continued nausea and emesis. She was \\npassing bowel movements and flatus. KUB was obtained showing \\nevidence of dilated loops of small bowel within the left upper \\nquadrant and partially fluid-filled loops of bowel in the mid \\nabdomen. GI consultation was obtained and she had a NG tube \\nplaced briefly, however, the pt pulled the tube shortly after \\nplacement due to discomfort. A CT A&P demonstrated dilated loops \\nof proximal ileum, with relatively decompressed distal ileum \\nconsistent with partial or early small bowel obstruction. She \\nwas medically managed with bowel rest, IVF and pain control with \\nimprovement of her symptoms. An empiric course of cipro/flagyl \\nwas continued from her OSH stay and was discharged to complete a \\n10 day course. She was instructed to follow up with \\nGastroenterology for an outpatient colonoscopy for further \\nevaluation. \\n\\n#. Ovarian Cyst - Repeat Transvaginal US was obtained on arrival \\nto ___ which demonstrated a large amount of free pelvic fluid, \\nwhich appears predominantly \\nsimple/transudative, (non-hemorrhagic which would be seen with a \\ncyst). Normal appearance of the ovaries on ultrasound, however, \\nCT showed a enhancing probable hemorrhagic corpus luteum cyst \\nmeasures 2.3 cm in diameter. The findings may represent a \\nruptured ovarian cyst, however, given the patient's history of \\nthree months of symptoms and GI findings it was not felt to be \\nthe most likely source of her current symptoms.   \\n.  \\n#. Iron Deficiency Anemia - B12 and folate WNL, Iron studies at \\nOSH with low ferritin. She was continued on her iron replacement \\ntherapy. \\n.\\n#. Chlamydia - The patient underwent a pap and pelvic exam at \\nOS___ with results positive for Chlamydia. The patient was \\nnotified of her infection and treated with azithromycin. Her \\npartner was also notified per pt request and instructed to be \\ntreated.\\n\\nDue to the holiday, a follow up appointment was not able to be \\nscheduled. She was provided the numbers of the ___ clinic and a \\nclinic in ___ for follow up primary care.\\n \\nMedications on Admission:\\nOutpatient: Iron\\nOn Transfer: Dilaudid 0.5mg IV Q4 PRN, Zofran PRN, Flagyl, \\nLevaquin, tylenol\\n \\nDischarge Medications:\\n1.

Your obstruction has improved with bowel \\nrest and fluids. It is very important that you follow up with \\nGastroenterology for a colonoscopy to evaluate for a cause of \\nyour obstruction as it may be related to inflammation of your \\nsmall bowel. You are being treated with antibiotics for a \\npotential infectious cause of your bowel inflammation. You \\nshould complete your antibiotic course as directed. \\n\\nYou were also treated with antibiotics for an infection found \\nduring your pelvic exam prior to transfer here. \\n\\nYou should obtain a primary care physician for further \\nmanagement of your medical problems. You have been given a phone \\nnumber for a clinic near your home, to establish care. \\n\\nPlease return to the emergency room if your abdominal pain \\nworsens, you notice any blood in your stool or if you develop \\nrecurrent nausea and vomiting.\\n\\nPlease eat a mild diet over the next ___ days, slowly increasing \\nyour food amount back to normal.
